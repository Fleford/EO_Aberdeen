       RANGE ANALYSIS 


       Constraint Ranges

  Lower/Upper Bound are the values of the RHS beyond which basis will change.
    Leaving is the variable which will leave the basis. 
    Entering is the variable which will enter the basis.
    If the entering or leaving variable is a constraint name,
      then the constraint slack variable is active

       Objective-Function Coefficient Ranges 

  Lower/Upper Bound are the values of the coefficients beyond which basis will change.
    Leaving is the variable which will leave the basis. 
    Entering is the variable which will enter the basis.
    If the entering or leaving variable is a constraint name,
      then the constraint slack variable is active
    Basic variables are shown with zero reduced cost

  Difference is computed by subtracting right hand side of the constraint 
    from the left side of the constraint.
  Precision limitations and nonlinear response may cause the 
    values of the binding constraints computed directly by the flow process 
    to differ from those computed using the linear program.
