 #  Supply2 test problem for GWM-VI
 #  The eighth entry in the first data line is ISTCB2 -
 #    Setting this to a negative number indicates that
 #    streamflows out of the reach will be saved to a
 #    binary file.  The absolute value of ISTCB2 is the
 #    unit to which unformatted flows will be written.
